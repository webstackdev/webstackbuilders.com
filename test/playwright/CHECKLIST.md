# Things to test with Playwright

- That RSS feed is generated and [validates](https://validator.w3.org/feed/)
- That `sitemap.xml` is generated
- That social share images are generated
- That favicon images are generated and correct HTML added to `<head>`
- That correct `manifest.json` file is generated. Need to verify the favicon output in manifest.json with that generated by the favicon plugin. https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs
- That JSON-LD markup is set correctly in a `<script>` tag in the header. Validators:
  * https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data
  * https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/
  * https://json-ld.org/playground/
