I started in IT as a Systems Analyst for a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company (Eli Lilly). I gained experience in preparing project specifications, estimating software development and resource costs, managing project lifecycles, and auditing existing systems. Part of my responsibility was maintaining a guide for new employees that outlined the company's software products, from Cray supercomputing for molecular modeling, IBM Z mainframes for data warehousing and ETL, to line-of-business systems shared between departments.
