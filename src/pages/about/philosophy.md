- I strive to keep my development process efficient and fully transparent, allowing us to deliver your software product on time and on budget.
- I provide high availability over whatever communication channel a client prefers - Zoom, Slack, IRC, Skype, and more. I have a toll free number if phone calls are convenient.
- I can match my work hours to both East Coat and Pacific Coast (U.S.) time zones, and have at least a six-hour overlay with GMT+2 (Europe).
- I can meet your needs for reporting on project progress, and clearly communicate any issues that may arise beforehand. I'm available as needed for standups, planning, and review meetings.
- I care about my work product and my measure my success by the value I add to your business. I'm not strongly opinionated, and adapted to client needs, whatever they may be - from move fast and break things, to well-documented and tested production code that's maintainable far into the future.
