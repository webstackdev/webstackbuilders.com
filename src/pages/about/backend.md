I admit - I love database technology. Normalization, procedures, triggers, indexes, and the math of graph traversal all interest me. I'm handy with vanilla SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL),  NoSQL (document, key/value, graph), and ORMs (data mapper and active record). I'm good at troubleshooting data layer problems.

I focus on Node Express (and friends), Laravel, and distributed serverless (RedwoodJS) platforms. I try to be an "inverted pyramid" developer instead of a "T" (broad general knowledge, deep in one specialty) or deeply specialized developer. I have experience working in Rails, Flask, and Spring, and have a frame of reference for design patterns and different approaches to solving problems on the back-end.
