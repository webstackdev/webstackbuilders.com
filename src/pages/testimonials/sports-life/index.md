Over the last few months I’ve had the pleasure to work with Dan on the relaunch of our new marketing site. His attention to detail and flexibility to work with in our team’s style made him a delight to work with. Additionally, as an American it was awesome to wake up each day to a fresh package of improvements. To that end we are planning to employ Dan to help us modernize our other two sites as well.
