We have had a web presence since 2006. When advancements in web technology passed our skill levels we hired various developers, but there was always a certain amount of monitoring and adjustment required to achieve the proper result. Working with Kevin has been a refreshing change. Kevin is an authority on web development and is clearly in the upper percentile in terms of developer qualifications. Kevin's invaluable suggestions and improvements helped create a stable, cross platform site.
