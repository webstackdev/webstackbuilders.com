Start with an outline of sections.

1. The Company - Profiles the client company that is the subject of the case study.
2. The Challenge - Profiles the challenge that they faced.
3. The Solution - Describes how your company was able to provide a solution for the client company.
4. Benefits - List three to four benefits (call them Sections 4a, 4b, 4c, etc.) that the client company received from using your company's solution, and describe each benefit in a paragraph or two per benefit.

Start out with what their life or business was like prior to finding the solution. Then describe the solution. Then describe how they are better after implementing the solution.
