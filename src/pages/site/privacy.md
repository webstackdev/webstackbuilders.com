# Privacy Policy

## Information regarding this site and its vendors.

This site and its owner do NOT store your personal information in any way. However, the site does use certain externally hosted services, each of which has its own privacy policies and methods of complying with applicable privacy regulations.

## Notes about external services

### Netlify

This site’s traffic goes through Cloudflare and is configured to use its Web Analytics tool, which Cloudflare claims doesn’t track individual users and doesn’t leave cookies.

### Google Analytics

Cloudinary hosts and serves most of the images on this site. A Cloudinary Support article says that your viewing of any such images involves no storage or use of your personal data.

### Fathom Analytics

This site uses Fathom Analytics, which does not store your personal data in any way. Please refer also to my article, “Fathom Analytics: count on it.”

### giscus

The site’s giscus commenting system, which is based on the GitHub Discussions search API, performs no tracking.

### Google Fonts

When I learned that the use of Google Fonts served from Google will transmit a visitor’s apparently not anonymized IP address1 to Google, I quit using this product (and suggesting to others that they use it) and, instead, served from my own site any typefaces that aren’t part of the so-called “system fonts stack.”

### Twitter

This site reproduces tweets as purely static text and downloaded images with no Twitter (or other) tracking involved. Each tweet is linked to its original location. Any Twitter-based image—including the avatar—that’s included with a static tweet does include a Twitter cookie, but no trackers.

### YouTube

This site uses lite-youtube-embed to provide YouTube embeds that respect your privacy. For details concerning how this works, see Sia Karamalegos’s article, “Faster YouTube embeds in Eleventy,” on which this site’s related templating is based.

For the discussion that convinced me to go this route after my initial skepticism about its necessity, see the Google Fonts GitHub issue, "GDPR compliance."
