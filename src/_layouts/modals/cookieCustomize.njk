    <p>These cookies, which include Google Analytics, allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our sites. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how users interact with each of ITHAKAâ€™s sites.

They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites.
