He doesn't just take a project and do it, he will break it down, check it ticks all the boxes (including the ones you forgot about!), and then deliver something beyond your expectations. Work with him without hesitation!"

His attention to detail and flexibility to work with in our team’s style made him a delight to work with. Additionally, as an American it was awesome to wake up each day to a fresh package of improvements. To that end we are planning to employ Dan to help us modernize our other two sites as well."
