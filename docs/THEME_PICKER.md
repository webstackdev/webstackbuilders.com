# Theme Picker info

The theme picker works by setting CSS attribute matchers for the `data-theme` attribute to the group of sitewide CSS variables, like `--color-bg`. That way, when the data theme is changed on the root document `<html>` element, the variable values in the CSS are changed as well. This is over-ridden locally in the theme picker modal, where the `data-theme` attribute is set on individual theme item cards so the card shows that theme's colors.

## Code Pieces

### Client script bundle for the modal and icon button

`src/assets/modules/themePicker`.

### Generate HTML for the Theme Picker Modal to choose different color themes

`src/_layouts/components/themePicker/themes.njk` creates the theme picker HTML by looping through `themes`. Data is generated by `_data/themes.js`.

### Generate HTML for the Theme Picker Icon to make the theme picker modal visible

`src/_layouts/components/themePicker/icon.njk`.

### Generate `<script>` HTML tag for the document head

`src/_layouts/components/themePicker/initial.njk` sets the `window.metaColors` global variable that is used to set a changed theme on the `<meta name="theme-color" content="CSS_VAR">` element used by the browser for UI surrounding the page like title bars.

### Set CSS variables like `--color-bg`

`src/assets/scss/variables/_themes.scss`.

## Places theme state is stashed away

- Set on the `data-theme` attribute for the document element:

  `<html data-theme="default">`

- Meta tag with "theme-color" for setting the surrounding UI by the browser:

  `<meta name="theme-color" content="#FFFFFF">`

- Theme Picker Modal Open and Closed State
  - Theme switcher modal `<div>` `hidden` attribute and `is-open` class
  - Theme switcher toggle button `aria-expanded` attribute

- State used internally by theme picker:
  - Sets `is-active` class and `aria-checked` attribute on active theme item card
  - Localstorage under THEME_STORAGE_KEY key as the string themeId of the current theme.
